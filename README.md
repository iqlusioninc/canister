Deploy self-contained binaries from [GCP Container Registry] (gcr.io) as systemd service units.

Supported release artifact formats are tarballs and [Docker `scratch`]-based images (i.e. single-layer only) containing the compiled binaries, as fetched from a Docker registry (in the form of a tarball). Our (as in [@iqlusioninc]'s) internal use of this tool is primarily with a Docker scratch-based workflow using a Docker-based build system (namely [GCP Cloud Build]).
